								<h4>February 2024</h4>
								<p>We are back with another action packed addition of the <strong>Island Ranger Journal</strong> from the Arran Pioneer Project, where we report each month on our work around the island. The role of APP Island ranger is currently shared by Zabdi and Simon.</p>

								<p>A shout out to the <strong>Ayrshire Climate Hub</strong>, who have supported our work this month setting up the seed nursery, composting, and running workshops. You can find out more about this initiative on the following link: <a href="https://www.energyagency.org.uk/ayrshire-climate-hub">Ayrshire Climate Hub</a>. </p>

								</div>

								<p>This February, we have turned our efforts to sowing seeds, and we have access to a beautiful glass greenhouse in the centre of Lamlash which has a rich heritage of island horticulture... more on that soon. We have set the glasshouse up with heat mats and a propagation cold frame so that we can germinate seeds early.  </p>

								</div>

								<p>In Whiting Bay we ran a composting workshop with <strong>Robin Gray</strong>, at his farm in Sandbraes, and we have built piles of compost from well rotted horse dung, seaweed, straw and mycellium. The compost piles have black pipes running through them in order to bring oxygen to the centre of the pile. </p>

										</div>
								</div>

								<p>We attended a planning meeting with <strong>Cladach Community Garden</strong>, where the group spent time discussing all the annual veg that they want to grow. We have helped to plant raspberry canes along with a bit of weeding, and also held scything sessions earlier in the month.  </p>

								</div>

								<p>At <strong>Cordon Community Garden</strong>, we kicked off February with a celebration of Imbolc, featuring soft fruit pruning with Kathy Sayer and then we headed along to the COAST Discovery Centre to make some St Brigid's crosses. Kathy also helped us to prune our fruit trees. The group here have done a lot of work mulching soft fruit and fruit trees. You can also follow progress at the garden on the following Facebook group: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/cordongarden/">Cordon Community Garden</a>.</p>

								<p>At the <strong>Pirnmill Community Garden</strong> we have lent a hand putting woodchip down on their no dig beds, and we held a fruit tree pruning demonstration with Kathy Sayer. There is a dry stone walling workshop coming up on March 10th - please email us on arran@pioneerproject.scot for more details.  </p>

								<p>At the <strong>Clauchlands Community Garden</strong> we welcomed a group from the <strong>Arran Outdoor Education Centre</strong>, who helped us to clear brambles to make space for fruit trees, and also planted hazel trees. We'll be down on the morning of Tuesday March 5th to plant fruit trees for anyone who wants to get involved.</p>

								</div>

								<p>At the <strong>Kilpatrick Community Garden</strong> we have continued to clear the brambles and we are planning for more soft fruit as we work towards establishing a forest garden or food forest. Come and join us on March 7th from 11am when we will be planting some soft fruit.</p>

								<p>We have also visited the <strong>Corrie Community Garden</strong> where there has been more great progress, you can follow their progress on the following Facebook group: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2089228118101831">Corrie Community Garden CIC</a></p>


								<p><strong>Hazel Coppices</strong> - We are distributing hazel trees to various organisations and individuals, including the <strong>Arran Community Land Initiative</strong>, <strong>Roots of Arran Communuity Woodland</strong>, and other Arran farmers and gardeners. We also received a large order of fruit trees and soft fruit, which we are planting at various sites around the island.  </p>

								<h4>January 2024</h4>
								<p>Hello and welcome to the first <strong>Island Ranger Journal</strong> from the Arran Pioneer Project, where we’ll be reporting each month on our work around the island. The role of APP Island ranger is currently shared by Zabdi and Simon.</p>

								</div>

								<p>January has been a very busy month as we prepare for the season ahead. Our team has been involved with a range of projects, including the gardens that we have helped to set up since 2020, and also other organisations on the island. We’ve also visited the High School to talk with the <strong>Roots and Shoots</strong> class, who helped paint veg signs for the Cordon garden. </p>

										</div>
								</div>

								<p>We have visited the <strong>Pirnmill Community Garden</strong> to work with the volunteers there, and have helped to build a hotbox propagator in the polytunnel.  We lined an open bottom box with sheeps wool then filled it with layers of bracken, horse dung and wood chip - this will heat up as the thermophile bacteria start munching and provide seedlings with a good start.  You have to shield their roots from getting too much heat and monitor the temperature.   It will provide great compost teaming with beneficial local micro organisms in time once it has broken down.  </p>

										</div>
								</div>

								<p>At the <strong>Kilpatrick Community Garden</strong> we are working to establish a food forest. We have worked to clear the bramble growth and mulching around the fruit trees and soft fruit bushes. We are planning to plant some strawberries. You can see a video update from the site on our Instagram reels by following this link: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2fjs6oM6h7/">Kilpatrick Community Garden: Progress Update</a>.  </p>

								<p>At <strong>Cladach Community Garden</strong>, we have started to clear the space ahead of the new season, we've helped to prune the Grape vine and take cuttings as well as general bramble bashing. We have Scything Sessions planned for this Saturday 3rd of February if anyone wants to get involved. </p>

								<p>We have also visited the <strong>Corrie Community Garden</strong> to take part in their No Dig garden workshop. You can follow their progress on the following Facebook group: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2089228118101831">Corrie Community Garden CIC</a></p>

								<p>In addition, we have continued our work establishing the <strong>Cordon Community Garden</strong>. We have brought a lot of seaweed off of the beach and horsedung from the neighbouring field, which we have been using in our compost bays. We have also added the seaweed directly to the no dig beds. This year we have decided not to use sheepswool and wood chip paths between the beds, as this will make it easier to weed, but we are still using these around the beds as a border. You can also follow progress at the garden on the following Facebook group: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/cordongarden/">Cordon Community Garden</a>.</p>

								</div>

								<p><strong>Hazel Coppices</strong> - We have provided trees and helped plant some Hazel coppices with some other Island organisations: Roots of Arran, Easmor, Arran Animal rescue centre, Pirnmill Community Garden, and other individuals.  </p>

								<p><strong>Snowdrop rescue</strong> - we have replanted some snow drops that were ripped up as they were in the roots that were torn out of the ground as the trees fell in the recent storms.</p>


								<p>That’s it for this month! See you in February. You can also follow our progress on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arranpioneerproject/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thearranpioneerproject/">Facebook</a> pages.  </p>
