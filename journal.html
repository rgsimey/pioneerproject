								<h4>January 2024</h4>
								<p>Hello and welcome to the first Island Ranger Journal from the Arran Pioneer Project, where we’ll be reporting each month on our work around the island.

								<p>January has been a very busy month as we prepare for the season ahead. Our team has been involved with a range of projects, including the gardens that we have helped to set up since 2020, and also other organisations on the island, and we’ve popped into the High School to talk with the Roots and Shoots class.</p>

								<p>We have visited the Pirnmill Community Garden to work with the volunteers there, and have helped to build a hotbox propagator in the polytunnel. </p>

								<p>In addition, we have continued our work establishing the Cordon Community Garden. We have brought a lot of seaweed off of the beach and horsedung from the neighbouring field, which we have been using in our compost bays. We have also added the seaweed directly to the no dig beds. This year we have decided not to use sheepswool and wood chip paths between the beds, as this will make it easier to weed, but we are still using these around the beds as a border (and a little bit in the compost bays too!)</p>

								<p>At the Glasshouse in the centre of Lamlash, we are working on setting up our Seed Nursery. We will start seeds to be shared with all of the food gardeners around Arran in return for open donation, and this will also be where we start seeds for the Cordon garden which is currently without an indoor growing space until we fix the polytunnel. </p>

								<p>At the Kilpatrick Community Garden we have worked to clear the bramble growth around the fruit trees and soft fruit that we have planted, and are now working towards establishing this as a food forest. </p>

								<p>We have visited the Corrie Community Garden for their No Dig garden workshop.  The team here have established a new CIC, and is currently rebranding to Arran Earth Garden. You can follow their progress on their Facebook page.</p>

								<p>At Cladach Community Garden, we have started to tidy up the space ahead of the new season. We have Scything Sessions planned for this Saturday 3rd of February if anyone wants to get involved. </p>

								<p>We have been involved with tree planting at the Roots of Arran Community Woodland and also at Easmore Ecology. Two years ago we took on hundreds of Hazel trees from the Forestry Commission, and have been looking after them until we find space to plant them, so it is great to work with other community groups to plant these around the island. We’ve also planted a few more in Kildonan. </p>

								<p>Finally, we popped in to the High School to talk with the Roots and Shoots class, talked about growing food locally, and had fun making some signs to be used at the Cordon garden</p>

								<p>That’s it for this month! See you in February. </p>
