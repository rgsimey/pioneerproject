								<p>Last updated: 01/03/23</p>

								<p>Please be aware that the schedule can sometimes change or new events added at short notice, and we will tend to reschedule outdoor events in very harsh weather. <strong>Please check back close to the date of any event that you wish to attend for any last minute updates, or email us on arran@pioneerproject.scot if you would like to receive email updates.</strong> </p>

								<p>Due to the nature of the work being undertaken, parking spaces are very limited (or not available), and we do not have toilet facilities onsite, though this is something we are working towards in future. We always recommend wearing sturdy footwear and bringing your own pair of gardening gloves (though there is sometimes a spare pair of gloves available). Please plan accordingly if you wish to attend.  </p>

								<h4>Support Our Work</h4>
								<p>We need input on many levels from people all over Arran, Ayrshire, Argyll and Scotland wide. We are always keen to engage with individuals, businesses, public bodies, and communities to help facilitate a range of tasks both locally and further afield as we want everyone to benefit from local and intergenerational knowledge share and enthusiasm, and are keen to facilitate this as widely as possible within, and between communities.</p>

								<p>We would be grateful for donations of all forms, from funding for research, volunteer participation time, tools, seeds, materials and other equipment, to support with events and social activities.</p>

								<p>Most importantly we hope to gain the support of our communities to join in, in any way that they can, there are plenty of roles for all ages, interests and abilities to play a part in supporting sustainable use of land for all our collective enrichment.</p>
